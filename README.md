This repository contains a number of data logging and control application tools for my personal use. There are similar applications derived from and listed in the Datalogger_BaseCode project found in my GitHub account. 

The applications run on the Arduino Uno R3 with the support of a number of libraries found on www.Arduino.org or distributors (Adafruit, Spark Fun, etc.) websites.

I place this on GitHub mainly as a way to experiment with versioning and synching projects between multiple computers for personal use.   If you happen to have stumbled on this repository you have my condolences.  If you find something of interest here, the license statement below should apply.
